This lab focuses on implementing and comparing various sorting and searching algorithms. The primary algorithms implemented include:

Binary Search: A fast search algorithm that works on sorted arrays.

Insertion Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

QuickSort: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. Both recursive and iterative versions are implemented, with different pivot selection strategies.

The lab also includes a performance comparison of these algorithms on arrays of varying sizes.

Files
BinarySearch.java: Contains the implementation of the binary search algorithm.

InsertionSort.java: Contains both iterative and recursive implementations of the insertion sort algorithm.

QuickSortRecursive.java: Contains recursive implementations of QuickSort with different pivot selection strategies (first element, random element, and middle element).

QuickSortIterative.java: Contains iterative implementations of QuickSort with different pivot selection strategies (first element, random element, and middle element).

Main.java: The main driver program that reads data from a file, runs the sorting and searching algorithms, and measures their performance.
